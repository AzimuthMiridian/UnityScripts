# About
This is a small repository for sharing some helpful Unity scripts that people might like to make use of and adapt. I cannot offer support for any of these, but you're welcome to make pull requests to add your own contributions! I welcome improvements and feedback. :) 

## BuildVRMBlendShapeClips.cs
This script is meant to help automate the tedious process of adding custom and ARKit blendshape values to VRM blendshape clips. I built this for my husband and I and thought other people might be able to make use of it, so I'm sharing it here. I recommend you have at least a passing familiarity with Unity, C#, and the VRM export process before using this, or have a friend that can help walk you through it.

Requirements:
1. A Unity project created with VRChat Creator Companion.
2. UniVRM (installed in the Unity project through your preferred method).
 
Usage:
1. Add the BuildVRMBlendshapeClips.cs file somewhere in your VRChat Unity project.
2. Check the console to ensure it compliled correctly and did not produce errors.
3. Navigate to Tools > Azimuth > Build VRM Blend Shape Clips and follow the instructions in the dialog.
